# Disk-and-Kernel-IO-Simulation
This project is a simulation of how processes interact with the kernel for I/O operations, emphasizing the role of kernel-mediated communication and the handling of disk operations. The simulation involves three types of processes: Disk Process, Kernel Process, and User Process.
